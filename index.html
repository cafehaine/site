					<h2>The art of multi-threading</h2>
					<cite>by <a href="#">CafÃ©Haine</a></cite>

				<main>
					<p>If you've ever wondered how to get more performance out of your programs, without using some specific language tricks, you've probably heard of multithreading. I'll try and explain in a really basic way how it works, and then show you when it can apply, how NOT to do it, and some final tips on how to use it.</p>

					<h3>What is multithreading</h3>
					<p> As you might know, your CPU has multiple cores. You can consider that a CPU core can run an application on its own. The goal of multithreading is to use multiple cores at the same time, in order to run faster.</p>
					<p>An application (process) can use multiple threads. A thread is where the code of your program is ran. It's the role of the OS to manage threads and split them amongst all of the availble cores.</p>
					<p>In order to use multiple cores to run faster, an application must use multiple threads, hence the name multi-threading.</p>
					<p>Now that you understand a little bit more about multithreading, let's talk about what you should NOT do. (If you still have some problems understanding this, please go check wikipedia.)</p>

					<h3>What not to do</h3>
					<p>As with any other kind of optimisation, you should consider a few things first.</p>
					<p>Is my application already functional? If you really think that your application can work on it's own, then you can consider adding multithreading as a feature. IT IS NOT A CORE FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
					<p>Another guestion you can ask yourself is: Will my application really benefit from multithreading? Most basic applications don't, and it will just be a painful task to try and add multithreading to it.</p>
					<p>You've decided to add multithreading to your application. Great, but if you use a language, like C#, which asks you to lock resources accessed by multiple threads, DO NOT OUTPUT YOUR RESULTS IN A SHARED VARIABLE. This will cause each thread to wait for all others to stop saving the result. Instead, just return multiple results that you can combine afterwards.</p>

					<h3>Some tips</h3>
					<p>Think about how to divide your workload before starting to code: Think about how cinebench r15, or my program Mass Resizer are doing it.</p>
					<p>Cinebench has a huge number of computations to do, so the total workload is divided in about 200 "tasks" to do, and each thread will work on a new task as their is finished.</p>
					<p>MassResizer is supposed to handle about 200 files, so I simply divided the number of files by the number of threads, which is much more simpler to do than Cinebench's way, but it also means that when approaching the end, fewer threads are working, as some may have finished their part faster.</p>
					<p>Anyway, I hope this helped you in some way, and I hope you will have less troubles realising your next multithreaded application.</p>
