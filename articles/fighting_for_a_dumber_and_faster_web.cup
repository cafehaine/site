Recently, I've re-written my website to be dumber, faster, and more secure. How
did I do it?. It's simple, no more PHP or any server-side code, and no more
javascript. I've gone back to the pre CGI 1993 era.

# What's the problem with current websites?

## The client side

Too many frameworks and libraries are used. This causes the websites to feel
slow to load on slow connections, and also slow to use if you're using a low-end
device, like a 5 years old phone.

This is why this website has 0 javascript. (yup, none, you can check.)

## The server side

Caching, databases, web servers, reverse proxies, containers, node.js packagesâ€¦
The stack that once was LAMP has become huge, complex, and hard to secure. This
setup might feel simpler for users of high level languages, but abstraction of
all of that infrastructure means most users don't know how their server run.

This is why this website is static, requiring only Linux, and Nginx. Everything
is computed only once, when I re-generate the website after adding an article.

# What's wrong with computing stuff client-side?

Computing something server-side means that you compute it once for potentially
thousands of served pages. When you run that computation on the client, you've
gone from one computation to thousands. A lot more energy is wasted, and your
page feels slower to the user, since the browser had to compute stuff before
displaying the page.

# Yeah but how can I do X without javascript?

It depends. One of the things you won't be able to do is Ajax. But is it really
a problem? If your website is much faster to load, is reloading a page after
filling a form that bad? Probably not.

Server-side code will most of the time be able to solve your problems.

For other things, html5 might already allow you to do such a thing:

You want to create a spoiler element that hides some text? Just use the
<details> element.

Want to have a popup menu? it's a bit more complex, but with hidden checkboxes,
you can achieve that.

Browsing the mdn website will allow you to discover a whole bunch of cool new
features, like css grids, and video subtitle tracks, that work without any
javascript.

# In conclusion
